# Kieran's Symbolic Calculator.

A calculator webapp that lets you easily type equations and solve for variables. Uses a Flask frontend with Mathquill for typing equations and a Sympy backend. This repository's a bit of a mess, but the calculator is hosted by [pythonanywhere](http://kchoislattery.pythonanywhere.com/), unless I forget to renew it. Sometimes it takes a bit of time to load, or you might have to refresh it if it throws a "something went wrong" error.
